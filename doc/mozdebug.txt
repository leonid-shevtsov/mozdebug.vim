*mozdebug.txt* Plugin for front-end debugging

This plugin uses a Firefox extension called MozRepl to control Firefox without
having to switch to the Firefox window itself. For instance, instead of having
to alt+tab ctrl+f5 to reload the page, you can 

>
map <silent> <F5> :MozReload<CR>
<

and just hit <F5> from Vim to reload the page.

Note: the plugin makes no attempt to find the "correct" tab in Firefox, and
    works with the currently selected one.

Note: MozRepl can be used to retrieve sensitive private information, like
    cookies, from your browser. Check that external connections to MozRepl are
    impossible (which is the default setting, by the way).

===============================================================================
Installation ~

You'll need MozRepl (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozrepl/) 
installed in your Firefox.

===============================================================================
Commands ~

:Mozrepl <javascript code> 
    Pass some code to be executed in Firefox via MozRepl

:MozReload
    Reload the current tab in Firefox

:MozReloadCss
    Instead reloading the whole tab, reload only its stylesheets

===============================================================================
Configuration ~

g:MozreplServer="(ip-address) (port)" 
    The address of Firefox's MozRepl server. The default should work fine, 
    unless Vim and Firefox are on different machines.

    The address and port must be separated with a space.

g:MozreplHighlightStyle="<css style>"
    The style of highlighting for MozreplHighlightSelector. The default
    is a bright magenta border. 

g:MozreplDebug=0/1
    Set to 1 to see actual commands passed to MozRepl
